Final Project README

- Overview:
Welcome to my game ELUSIVITY. 
It is an infinite arcade styled horror game which uses sounds and darkness to it's advantage. 


- Objective:
You must survive as long as possible. You can attempt to reach a new high score, but the longer you survive the harder it'll become
to reach a new high score next round.


- Mechanics:
Use WASD or Arrow keys to move, while using your mouse to look around.


- Obstacles:
It lurks.
A creature hides within the walls, blending in with the darkness.
It is formally known as The Mimic, a creature that can use it's body flexibility to mimic the movements of a living being
to hunt its prey, when in reality it is just a mass of unknown black void material.
